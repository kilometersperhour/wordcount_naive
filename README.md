# wordcount_naive
My first Go program. Not really sure what to expect.

The goal here is to actually develop a good solution to an exam question I received once.
Hopefully I will be able to emulate the function of "wc" from Linux, an executable that gives counting stats about a text file, specifically *w*ord *c*ount, number of newlines, and number of bytes in (size of) the file.
